# lstm-project


solar-power generation forecasting using lstm.

To improve lstm performance, We use ensemble technique. (bagging, stacking)

train : 70% , validation : 20% of training data , test : 30%

##another emsemble##

- we decide to use simple ensemble stragies, we will now focus on the dataset. 

- we divide dataset into 3 ~ 5 dataset. 

- Then we will use these data for training the models.

- The rates are same. (train, test, validation)


##0126##

- data divide -> 0 ~ 14000, 1000 ~ 15000 , 2000 ~ 16000...
